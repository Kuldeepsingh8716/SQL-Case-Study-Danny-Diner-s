Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

Problem Statement
Danny aims to understand customer behavior, including visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items, to enhance his loyalty program and provide a personalized experience. To achieve this, he needs insights from the data to evaluate if expanding the loyalty program is beneficial. Danny has provided sample datasets—sales, menu, and members—due to privacy concerns. He seeks your assistance in generating SQL queries to analyze this data effectively. These queries will help Danny answer key questions and evaluate customer engagement. The datasets and an entity relationship diagram are available for inspection to aid in writing these queries.
